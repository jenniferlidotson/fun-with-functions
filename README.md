# Lab: Fun with Functions

## Problem Domain

I created my own repo using the [code-201-lab5a Template Repo](https://github.com/codefellows/code-201-lab5a), and then created solutions to some code problems such that my solutions passed the included tests.

## Process

* Given starter code in the `index.html` and `app.js` files inside of this directory. The success of code was determined by whether it passed tests that were in the `tests.js` file.

* Created a new branch for each code problem, and merged each branch into *main* on GitHub (and then pulled back into main) when the problem was completed.
